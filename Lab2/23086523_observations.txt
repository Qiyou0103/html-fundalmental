Task 1: Inline Styling
What I did:

Added inline styles to <body> (off-white background, teal text) and <h1> (teal background, off-white text).

Made one paragraph inherit styles and another override text color.

What happened:

First paragraph followed body styles.

Second paragraph had gray text instead of teal.

Why:

Inline styles override inherited styles.

Conclusion:

Good for quick fixes but messy for big projects.

Task 2: Embedded CSS
What I did:

Used <style> in <head> to style body, h1, and h2 with purple colors.

What happened:

Whole page turned purple-themed.

No need to repeat styles for each h2.

Why:

Embedded CSS applies to the whole page.

Conclusion:

Better than inline but still not reusable across pages.

Task 3: Font Styling
What I did:

Changed fonts, added shadows to h1, centered h2, and indented paragraphs.

What happened:

Text looked cleaner and more professional.

Why:

CSS properties like text-shadow improve design.

Conclusion:

Small changes make a big difference.

Task 4: Class Selectors
What I did:

Made classes (.nav, .feature, .footer) to style navigation, list items, and footer.

Used <span class="company"> to style just the company name.

What happened:

Navigation got bigger/bolder, some list items turned red, footer got smaller/italic.

Company name stood out.

Why:

Classes let you reuse styles.

Conclusion:

Saves time and keeps styling consistent.

Task 5: ID Selectors
What I did:

Used IDs (#item1, #item2) to style list items differently.

Tried using the same ID twice (invalid).

What happened:

Each item had unique colors.

Browser still applied styles when ID was reused, but itâ€™s wrong.

Why:

IDs must be unique (one per page).

Conclusion:

Use IDs for one-time styles, classes for reuse.

Extra: Multiple Classes
What I did:

Gave one element two classes (class="nav feature").

What happened:

It combined styles from both classes.

Why:

Multiple classes work together.

Conclusion:

Useful for mixing styles.
